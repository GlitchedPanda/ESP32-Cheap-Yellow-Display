# Setup and Configuration options

This page will cover the basics of setting up the CYD

## Hardware Setup

There really is nothing to setup here, just connect the CYD to a computer using a micro USB cable (it even comes with one)

## Software Setup

The driver needs to be setup for uploading to the CYD, including webflashing projects. 

### Driver

The CYD uses the CH340 USB to UART chip. If you do not have a driver already installed for this chip you may need to install one. Check out [Sparkfun's guide for installation instruction](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ch340-drivers/all)

## Coding Setup

Follow these instructions if you want to write new code for the CYD

### Board definition

You will need to have the ESP32 setup for your Arduino IDE, [instructions can be found here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html).

You can then select basically any ESP32 board in the boards menu. (I usually use "ESP32 Dev Module", but it doesn't really matter)

If you see errors uploading a sketch, try setting board upload speed to `115200`

### Library Configuration

The CYD can work with a selection of different libraries, but the main one this repo will focus on is [TFT_eSPI](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI) as it is a fairly popular library for working with these types of dsiplays and there are lots of examples. 

This can be installed from the library manager by searching for "TFT_eSPI".

 > Note: After install of the library, copy the file [User_Setup.h](https://github.com/witnessmenow/ESP32-Cheap-Yellow-Display/blob/main/DisplayConfig/User_Setup.h) to the `libraries\TFT_eSPI` Arduino folder. This sets up the library for use with this display.
